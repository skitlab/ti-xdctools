This directory contains a basic SimpliciTI board support package (BSP) for the 
MSP430F5529 experimenter's board (exp430F5529).

It differs from a 'typical' SimpliciTI BSP in the following ways:

- It does not provide support for buttons
- It does not provide support for flashing LEDs
- It does not do any configuration of clocks or the core voltage; these are
  left to the application domain

It should support multiple radio types, but so far it has only been tested with
a CC1100 radio module.
